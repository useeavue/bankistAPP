# Bankist Application

This is a simple application that represents functionality of a bank.

You have two accounts: Jonas and Jessica

Jonas {
    login: js,
    password: 1111,
   };
   
Jessica {
    login: jd,
    password: 2222,
   };
   
You can transfer money through accounts, request a bank loan (10% of highest deposit) and close current account.

It's completely working, however I want to add a currency rates API so you can monitor current rates and doing transfers based on that.
